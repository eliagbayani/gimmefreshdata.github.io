#Fresh Data - a Biodiversity Data Availability Monitor*

*A prototype. Please note that searches by trait and/or time ranges are not yet enabled.

The purpose of [Fresh Data](https://github.com/gimmefreshdata/freshdata) is to discover and follow records in biodiversity archives that match specific geospatial, temporal, taxonomic and trait constraints. About half a billion records are included from sources like [GBIF](http://gbif.org), [iDigBio](http://idigbio.org) and [EOL TraitBank](http://eol.org/traitbank).

Visit our [wiki](https://github.com/gimmefreshdata/freshdata/wiki) for more information.
